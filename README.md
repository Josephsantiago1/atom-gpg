# atom-gpg package

Package to encrypt/decrypt selections with GPG.

## Install

You need to have gpg installed.

If you get error message "Failed to spawn command gpg. Make sure gpg is installed and on your PATH" then you need to go to Settings page and set Gpg Executable path.

As this is not yet Atom Package, you need to do the following things manually:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/jpohjolainen/atom-gpg.git ~/.atom/packages/atom-gpg

$ cd ~/.atom/packages/atom-gpg

$ npm install underscore-plus
```
